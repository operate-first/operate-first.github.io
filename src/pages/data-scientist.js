                Iâ€™m a data scientist comfortable with Jupyter Notebooks on my laptop, but need specialized hardware and production level support to deploy my model as part of an ML application and donâ€™t know where to start. Check out the [Espresso Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8VBRDTElCWpneB4dBu4u1kHElZVWfAwW) on our YouTube channel.
